        <p>In all of the programming courses you've taken and languages you've learned, you have 
            practiced the process and <em>art</em> of writing modular code, using objects and methods,

        <p>Take a moment to consider the structure and functionality of your application. How many 
            ways could it be deconstructed into smaller architectural and functional pieces?</p>
        <p>Using an <em>n-Tiered</em> architecture model, the presentation layer, the data access 
            layer, the business logic layer are constructed as separate entities. Are there other 
            components or subsystems that could be employed to simplify your design and implementation?</p>
        <p>As an example, a separate, standalone application could be used to perform select, 
            <em>privileged</em> functions, that are not available to a web-enabled user application 
            reducting the authentication requirements. If the web app doesn't have the capability 
            to perform certain actions on a given data-space, the security requirements are eased 
            whereas the admin functions for the same data set might only be available to a desktop 
            application installed on a particular workstation.</p>

        <div id="stackoverflow" style="padding: 30px;">
            <p>Both concepts (<strong>abstraction and decomposition</strong> are analysis &amp; 
                design basic techniques. There are interrelated and normally used together during 
                software development. We use them even though we are not always aware of it. Deeper 
                understanding of these concepts helps to be more accurate and effective in A&amp;D.</p>
            <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> in general is a process of consciously ignoring some 
                aspects of a subject under analysis in order to better understand other aspects 
                of it. In other words, it kind of <em>simplification</em> of a subject. In software 
                in particular, analysis &amp; design are all about abstraction.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>When you model your DB, you ignore UI and behavior of your system and concentrate 
                    only on DB structure</li>
                <li>When you model your architecture, you concentrate on high-level modules and their 
                    relationships and ignore their internal structure</li>
                <li>Each UML diagram for example gives a special, limited view on the system, therefore 
                    focusing on a single aspect and ignoring all other (sequences abstract objects and 
                    messages, deployment abstracts network and servers, use cases abstract system users 
                    and their interactions with a system, etc)</li>
                <li>Writing source code in any programming language requires a lot of abstraction - 
                    programmers abstract app's functionality using limited set of language constructs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Decomposition</strong> is an application of the old good principle "divide and 
                conquer" to software development. It is a technique of classifying, structuring and 
                grouping complex elements in order to end up with more atomic ones, organized in 
                certain fashion and easier to manage. In all phases there are lots of examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>functional decomposition of a complex process to hierarchical structure of smaller 
                    sub-processes and activities</li>
                <li>high-level structure of an complex application to 3 tiers - UI, logic and data</li>
                <li>Class structure of a complex domain</li>
                <li>namespaces as a common concept of breaking a global scope into several local ones</li>
                <li>UML packages are a direct use of decomposition on the model level - use packages 
                    to organize your model</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Abstraction is somehow more generic principle than decomposition, kind of "father of all principles" :)</p>
