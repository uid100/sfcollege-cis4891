        <h3>[Top-Level] User Requirements</h3>
        <p>Identifying, decomposing and managing formal requirements is an important 
            part of software engineering.</p>
        <p>System requirements are often supported by <strong>User Stories</strong>, 
            <strong>Use-Cases,</strong> and <strong>Use-Case Diagrams</strong>. Don't 
            confuse these. They sound similar but it is important to be able to explain 
            how they are similar and to distinguish between them.</p>

    <div id="user-stories" style="padding: 20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">User Stories</h2>
        <p>The process of developing system requirements usually begins with identifying 
            the user need for a solution or developing a problem description.</p>
        <p>This is usually expressed as <strong>user stories.</strong></p>
        <div class="boxed-paragraph">The <em>user story</em> is a simple statement expressing 
            a user or customer's need or desire for a solution. It should be expressed from 
            the user's perspective</div>
        <p>The user story follows a standard 3-part format, indicating:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>role</li>
            <li>request</li>
            <li>result</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>As a</strong> potential customer</li>
            <li><strong>I need</strong> to see customer reviews</li>
            <li><strong>So that</strong> I can make an informed product selection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>User stories</strong> are usually written in collaboration with a 
            customer or end user and express operational needs from the user's point 
            of view.</p>
        <p>These are simple expressions and during the initial phase of <em> capturing 
            originating requirements </em> as many of these should be gathered as 
            possible to describe the goals of the system.</p>
        <p>This standard format is easily recognizable and easy to follow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>As a</strong> <em>[Persona]</em></li>
            <li><strong>I want/need</strong> <em>[Functionality]</em></li>
            <li><strong>So that</strong> <em>[Desired Outcome]</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Notice that sometimes the solution the user is requesting may not be the 
            best solution for the desired outcome. Also, understanding the user's 
            role and intended operational environment is essential to developing a 
            usable and useful solution.</p>
        <p>Formally, <strong><i>User Stories</i></strong> should include acceptance 
            criteria specifying starting condition, action, and demonstrated objective. 
            This is not always included at this stage.</p>

    <div id="use-cases" style="padding: 20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Use Cases</h2>
        <div id="use-case-definition" class="boxed-paragraph" style="font-style: italic;">
            <p>In simple terms, a use case is an account of how a person who uses a certain 
                process will achieve a goal. In technical terms, it is the description of 
                the interaction between system and actors. The product of this process is a 
                document containing all the steps followed by a user to achieve a goal.</p>
            <p>(from: https://www.digitalnatives.hu/blog/user-story-vs-use-case/)</p>
        </div>
        <p>A Use-Case is a textual description of how a person will use a system to accomplish 
            an objective.</p>
        <p>There are many template examples for Use Cases. Although these may differ, and may 
            be tailored to meet a particular need or audience, these will generally include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brief description</strong> (or title)</li>
            <li><strong>The [relevant] system</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The actor(s)</strong> including those initiating or responding to events</li>
            <li><strong>Scenario</strong> usually will include the pre-existing conditions and 
                (all) relevant action sequences</li>
            <li><strong>Expected result</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Use cases can be quite detailed and should describe all of the actions and measurable 
            results required to meet the user requirements.</p>
        <p>The <em>Use-Case</em> may derive from one or more <em>User Stories</em>.</p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info"><strong> A <em>Use-Case</em> is not the same thing as a 
            <em>User Story.</em> </strong></p>

        <h2 class="alert">A Graphical Summary</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</strong> is a formal standard (currently v2.5) 
            specification which defines 14 types of engineering diagrams, 7 <em>behavioral,</em> 
            and 7 <em>structural</em></p>
        <p>

                alt="UML2.5 Diagram Overview" /></p>
        <p>One of these formal diagram definitions is the <strong>use case diagram</strong> which is 
            a graphical representation of a set of use-cases depicting their interaction with actors 
            either inside or outside of the system boundary.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The system boundary indicating which activities take place inside and outside of the 
                system. The system boundary is represented by a box around the use case(s)</li>
            <li>The actors, in this case all of them are indicated outside of the system boundary. The 
                actors are a generalized persona. If multiple instances of a role are expected, only 
                one <em>actor</em> is indicated to represent that role. Actors do not need to be users, 
                they may represent external systems or APIs. They are represented by a stick figure</li>
            <li>Straight lines are drawn indicating interaction between actor and use case.</li>
            <li>Relevant use cases are represented in the diagram. All use cases associated with the 
                system do not need to be included in the diagram to make the diagram useful.</li>
            <li>Use cases are represented with a labeled oval shape.</li>
            <li>The use case diagram is <em>not</em> an activity diagram or flow chart. Activity is not 
                indicated by "flow" lines between use cases.</li>
