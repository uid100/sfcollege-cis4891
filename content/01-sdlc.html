        <h2 class="alert">What is a Project?</h2>
        <div id="project-definition" class="boxed-paragraph">
            The <strong>Project Management Institute's</strong> <em>Book of Knowledge</em> defines a <strong>Project</strong> as a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.</div>
        <div id="project">
            <p>It is important to distinguish between:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                <li>Projects</li>
                <li>Products</li>
                <li>Operations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A <strong>Product</strong> may be the result of one or several projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Operations</strong> are ongoing activities to support various objectives.</p>
            <p>This course is about completing a project.</p>
            <p>As a <em>temporary endeavor,</em> a project must have a beginning and an end. Projects are intended to finish.</p>
            <p>As a <em>temporary endeavor,</em> a project has its own life cycle. That life cycle is characterized by its own phases. Such as:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                <li>Initiating</li>
                <li>Planning</li>
                <li>Execution</li>
                <li>Monitoring</li>
                <li>Closing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Although we may use the terms interchangably, it is important to understand the difference.</p>
            <p>Through this course, we will be undertaking a project which is designed to create a product and associated artifacts (which are also products). The products are an important objective of a project, the processes are also.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Other definitions wil support this. <em> "An undertaking", "a scheme", "a set of tasks." </em> All of these are a good reminder that the <em>project</em> is the action of creating, not what we create.</p>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div id="objective">
            <h2 class="alert">Objective</h2>
            <p>A project has a purpose. In our case, the objective of our project is to build a working software application. Specifically, an <em>n-tiered</em> application which uses an API to store and retrieve data to a database, and one or more applications which will make calls to the API to read and write that data and present it to a user.</p>
            <p>As a means of building that application, you will step through the phases of the Software (or System) Development Life cycle (SDLC).</p>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div id="sdlc">
            <h2 class="alert">SDLC</h2>
            <p>Like a project has a life cycle with distinct phases, the engineering effort also defines phases for development.</p>
            <p>There are variations of how they get accomplished, but it is widely recognized that there are logical steps which should be accomplished as part of the <em>process</em> of software (and system) development.</p>
            <p>Just for fun, I searched the web for the phases of this <em>widely recognized</em> SDLC.</p>

            <p>You get the idea. I even found one source that listed 10 phases.</p>
            <p>Compare the lists. Each of these may be tailored to an organization or to a particular <em>project,</em> but aren't really that fundamentally different. By the way, this is a common interview discussion question. When you are asked the phases of the SDLC, you can discuss that the processes and phases are usually tailored to the organization, but all have in common that you have to know what you are going to build before you build it, the design an approach, build and test your solution, and be prepared to support the product.</p>
            <p>There. I summarized all of these lists, and this list does not match any of the search results. But it seems reasonable that we should decide what we are going to do before we do it.</p>

            <h2 class="alert">Our Approach</h2>
            <p><em>So where does that leave us?</em></p>
            <p>Hopefully all that makes some sense. This semester, we will be stepping through a representative development cycle. It is typical, but it is not the only path. Later, we will discuss some of the variations and even some that are controversial and why.</p>
            <p>Like any project, this one will have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>limited schedule (the academic term),</li>
                <li>limited budget (your number of reasonable available hours),</li>
                <li>and defined scope (what you decide to build that meets the requirements).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Concept Definition</h3>
            <p>For the first part of your project, over the next couple of weeks, you will define what it is you will build. This is not delaying your project this is part of the project.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite quotes:</p>
            <div class="boxed-paragraph">"A plan is a point of departure."</div>
            <p>With a plan, we have direction. We can start down a path, recognizing that the plan may change, but there always needs to be a plan.</p>
