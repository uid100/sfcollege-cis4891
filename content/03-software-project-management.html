        <h2 class="alert">Managing Software Projects</h2>
        <p>In module 1, we talked about what a project is and a little about the linear sequence of management phases.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, these management phases were linked closely to development tasks. In a perfect situation, this is a very good approach. Even better, if you know everything about a project, how long each activity will take, and have assurance that nothing <em>unexpected</em> could or will happen when launching a project and laying out the plan, and monitoring and tracking progress.</p>
        <p>Of course the ideal situation doesn't exist, so managing projects consists as much of reporting progress as dealing with obstacles along the way.</p>
        <p><em>Why does it matter?</em></p>
        <p>Project management is ultimately focused on three things, schedule, budget, and scope. A project that misses schedule or goes over budget, or doesn't meet requirements, not only disappoints a customer, but can be very costly to an organizations brand reputation and have far-reaching impacts.</p>
        <div class="boxed-paragraph">Sometimes called <strong>The Iron Triangle</strong> or the <strong> triple constraint </strong>. If you imagine that these three (time, cost, scope) are laid out on a triangle, you cannot change one without impacting another. If you add requirements, you have to add time or cost, if an activity takes longer, it almost certainly costs more. If the customer wants it faster and cheaper, then something else has to be cut from the delivery.</div>

        <p><em>"This is just a classroom activity, what does this have to do with us?"</em></p>
        <p>As a student, you are certainly constrained by schedule. There is limited time in the semester, and that can't be extended.</p>
        <p>Also cost, if you recognize that budget can be translated to hours, there are only so many hours in a day and sleeping and eating are also necessary.</p>
        <p>That just leaves scope as the variable to be controlled. You can plan for a very complex, market ready software application with a long set of requirements, but with limited resources and fixed delivery dates, sometimes we need to defer capabilities for later. Don't hesitate to add <em>wish-list</em> or future capabilities to your plan.</p>
        <p>These <em>backlog</em> items are good to have, but keep your deliveries realistic, keep your progress consistent, and don't procrastinate.</p>
        <p>In past classes, at the end of a project when students have presented their results and lessons learned, one of the common regrets I have heard is, "I wish I hadn't waited to get started."</p>
