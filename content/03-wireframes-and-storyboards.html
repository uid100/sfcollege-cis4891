        <h2 class="alert">UI/UX and Wireframe Diagrams</h2>
        <p>The graphical user interface (GUI) is what the user sees and how they interact with your application. How well it is designed will have a direct impact on how easy it is to use and understand. Combined with the implementation and the functionality, this shapes the user experience (UX).</p>
        <p>Even a well-designed interface that is intuitive and attractive can frustrate a user if the implementation is not correct or the server response is unreasonably slow or the workflow is not logical.</p>
        <p>As part of the design phase, create wireframe diagrams to illustrate the logical workflow for the use to interact.</p>
        <p>Wireframe drawings are not intended to be <em>pretty</em> finalized documents, they generally do not include color schemes or finished images or font choices. What they do show is approximate location of input and output elements.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>

        <p>A wireframe sketch can be a very useful tool in clarifying logical workflows and even identifying logic errors.</p>

        <h2 class="alert">User Interface Design Principles</h2>
        <h3>Keep the interface simple.</h3>
        <p>The best interfaces are almost invisible to the user. They avoid unnecessary elements and are clear in the language they use on labels and in messaging.</p>
        <p>There was a time when every software release needed user training. A measure of success might include an interface that is familiar to the user, the first time they see it.</p>
        <h3>Create consistency and use common UI elements.</h3>
        <p>By using common elements in your UI, users feel more comfortable and are able to get things done more quickly. It is also important to create patterns in language, layout and design throughout the site to help facilitate efficiency. Once a user learns how to do something, they should be able to transfer that skill to other parts of the site.</p>
        <p>If a team or teams of engineers are working on different areas of the interface, or the application is being integrated into another operational context, care should be taken to ensure a familiar <em>look and feel.</em></p>
        <h3>Be purposeful in page layout.</h3>
        <p>Consider the spatial relationships between items on the page and structure the page based on importance. Careful placement of items can help draw attention to the most important pieces of information and can aid scanning and readability.</p>
        <h3>Strategically use color and texture.</h3>
        <p>You can direct attention toward or redirect attention away from items using color, light, contrast, and texture to your advantage.</p>
        <h3>Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity.</h3>
        <p>Carefully consider how you use typeface. Different sizes, fonts, and arrangement of the text to help increase scanability, legibility and readability.</p>
        <h3>Make sure that the system communicates whats happening.</h3>
        <p>Always inform your users of location, actions, changes in state, or errors. The use of various UI elements to communicate status and, if necessary, next steps can reduce frustration for your user.</p>
        <h3>Think about the defaults.</h3>
        <p>By carefully thinking about and anticipating the goals people bring to your site, you can create defaults that reduce the burden on the user. This becomes particularly important when it comes to form design where you might have an opportunity to have some fields pre-chosen or filled out.</p>
        <p>These values may be constants or may be calculated by the application and be context-aware.</p>
