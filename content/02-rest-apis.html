        <p>You have likely heard the term <strong>REST API</strong> and maybe <strong>RESTful Services</strong>.</p>
        <p>Let's discuss what they mean. There is a lot here, but it's mostly review. Take the time to read through 
            it and let me know if it makes sense, and if you agree, or if you don't!</p>

                <h3>Transport Layer</h3>
                <p>Without getting into too much detail, here is a brief refresher description of some common networking terms and concepts such as internet protocols and layers, and some simple definitions. These should be familiar. Perhaps this will fill in some gaps of understanding.</p>
                <div id="protocol">
                    <h4>Protocol</h4>
                    <p><img style="float: right;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/500634/files/60005892/preview" alt="c-3po" width="210" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/500634/files/60005892" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
                    <p>A <strong>protocol</strong> is an agreed upon set of rules.</p>
                    <p>When business partners meet in the office, they will commonly exchange greetings and shake hands. During a first meeting with a hiring manager for an interview, it is unlikely that you would begin with a punch in the arm or a warm embrace. These are protocols. Two systems must understand and agree on the same rules for communication to be successful.</p>
                    <p>When <em>C-3PO</em> is introduced in the movie, <strong>STAR WARS</strong>, he indicates that he is <em> "A protocol droid, versed in over 6 million languages." </em> (Strangely non-specific for a protocol droid.) This means that he really had no skills except to be an interface between other systems.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Network communication, and especially across the internet, most commonly use one of two communications protocols (sets of rules); TCP/IP or UDP/IP. These are also called <strong>transport layer</strong> protocols.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                </div>
                <div id="tcp">
                    <h4>TCP/IP</h4>
                    <p><strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</strong> is the <strong>Internet Protocol (IP) </strong> which relies on a packet transfer using a communications handshake between sender and receiver to ensure that the message received is complete and correct.</p>
                    <p>Imagine if I took a jigsaw puzzle that was all put together, turned it over and sequentially numbered all of the pieces before taking it apart and giving you all of the pieces. You could very quickly and easily reassemble those pieces and if any were missing, you cold tell me precisely which pieces were missing and I could resend you those pieces (packets.)</p>
                    <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/500634/files/60005950/preview" alt="numbered jigsaw puzzle pieces" width="300" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/500634/files/60005950" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
                    <p>If I need to you an image, or an email, I want to make sure that what you receive is exactly what I sent and I need to take the time to make sure of it. This is sometimes called <em>Lossless</em>.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                </div>
                <div id="udp">
                    <h4>UDP/IP</h4>
                    <p>In contrast, <strong>Uniform Datagram Protocol (UDP/IP)</strong> allows the sending process to send messages very quickly without error checking or halting transmission for re-sending dropped pieces.</p>
                    <p><img style="float: right;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/500634/files/60005914/preview" alt="pixelated image stream" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/500634/files/60005914" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
                    <p>Using the analogy above, maybe you received enough of the jigsaw puzzle to tell what the picture is and you are anxious to get the next.</p>
                    <p>This <em>Lossy</em> transmission is commonly used for near real-time (NRT) communications such as gaming.</p>
                    <p>You have almost certainly seen this before when a TV picture <em>pixelates</em> a movie or NFL football game which is being broadcast or <em>streamed</em> to your device. This is often used for point to multi-point transmission. Imagine if the broadcast had to stop for error corrections because someone in another town missed some packets and everyone had to wait for them to be retransmitted.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Missing a few seconds of a sports broadcast when the network slows is considered acceptable, but imagine if it was a contract email. Missing pieces could have big consequences. That is the fundamental difference between the two.</p>

            <div id="application">
                <h3>Application Layer</h3>
                <p>Once we've agreed on how systems will send / receive data, there is another set of protocols, the <em>application layer</em>. If you think of the transport layer as the shared spoken language, the application layer is the game rules. If a baseball team took the field in their agreed upon positions, across the infield and outfield, and the opposing team lined up along the first baseline wearing football pads ready for a scrimmage, the result would be chaos.</p>
                <p><img style="display: block; margin: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/500634/files/60005916/preview" alt="futbol on hockey skates" width="480" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/500634/files/60005916" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
                <p>Instead, there are well defined services, such as Telnet and ftp and http, and each has it's own set of <em>playing</em> rules and places to play, ports.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>HTTP</h4>
                <p>To continue the sports analogy, baseball has a defined set of actions, pitch, catch, bat, run, and others, and each action has a protocol. A controlled and expected set of rules that make the game playable.</p>
                <p>The Hyper-text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has its own set of <em>actions</em> GET, POST, PUT, and others. When one of these correctly formatted action requests is sent to the correct waiting service, a server listening at a known address and port, it will generate and answer with a correctly formatted response, such as a web page.</p>
                <p>You are well-acquainted with Hyper-text Markup Language (HTML) web pages, these are blocks of text containing a header and a body with paired <em>tags</em> which instruct the receiver how to render and view the object.</p>
                <p>But sometimes a <em>web request</em> returns a block of data that isn't intended to be formatted and viewed on a browser. Sometimes the response is a block of formatted data (often <em>json</em> or <em>xml</em>) instead.</p>
                <p><img style="display: block; margin: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/500634/files/60005918/preview" alt="simple json example" width="420" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/500634/files/60005918" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
                <hr />
                <h4>Stateless</h4>
                <p>Before we leave our protocol discussion, there is one more point to discuss. HTTP is called a <em>stateless</em> protocol. That means that each request / response is separate from every other request / response. There is no inherent <em>session</em> knowledge.</p>
                <p>Imagine an attendant sitting in a ticket window at a movie theater. This is a <em>server</em>. If a customer approaches with an expected request, buying tickets, the server (attendant) completes the transaction with an expected response. If it is a busy theater, there may be more windows (ports) open. If a customer approaches and tries to order tacos, it is likely considered an incorrect request, and the server will not respond, or maybe return a <strong>500-level</strong> server error. If the customer tries to buy tickets for a movie that is not currently playing, the server might return a <strong>404</strong> <em>not found</em> error. It is not a server error, the request was correct, but the server does not have the correct data to deliver the response the user (client) had hoped.</p>
                <p>Now, once that transaction has successfully completed and the client has received their movie tickets, they can start another request. When the client makes this new request, maybe to buy 2 more tickets, the window attendant might remember them, but in the case of the HTTP server, every request is brand new. The next two tickets might be in the seats next to the last request but there is no guarantee. The server doesn't know who the client is unless that information is part of the request. The customer may as well have walked up to any one of 20 ticket windows. Every request is new.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><em>Don't you know who I am?</em></p>
                <p><img style="display: block; margin: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/courses/500634/files/60005938/preview" alt="Ron Burgundy" width="320" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/courses/500634/files/60005938" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>

        </div>
        <div id="api">
            <h2 class="alert">API</h2>
            <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. This is a little vague and can mean different things in different contexts. Always though, it is an <em>interface</em> between two entities with an agreed set of rules.</p>
            <p>For our purposes, it is an HTTP server which will return a dataset instead of an HTML-formatted document. The requests may come from a browser, which is usually looking for an HTML document that it can happily display as the page author intended, but the request may come from any other client as well including another web server, a web application, or even from a command line (lookup <em>curl</em>).</p>
            <p><em>What does a web API do?</em></p>
            <p>Actually, not very much. (Remember C-3PO?) The purpose of a web API should be limited to delivering and receiving data without worrying about how it is going to be used.</p>
            <div class="ic-flash-info">
                <p>From a command line, try this:</p>
                <pre>curl https://catfact.ninja/fact</pre>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Try it a couple more times. What happens?</p>
            </div>
            <p><em>Then, why include it?</em></p>
            <p>Because if we recognize the <strong> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) </strong> or <strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> best practice, using an API means that (1.) our client application doesn't need to know how or where the data is stored or collected. It also means (2.) other client applications can access the same dataset without worrying that one of those several client applications alter logic which would unknowingly affect all of the other applications, and (3.) greatly simplifies testing by simplifying all of the components. Also, (4.) if the data source changes or a component needs to be updated, as long as the interface is clearly defined, updating or replacing the component does not require a complete rewrite of a working system.</p>
            <p>You could argue that a waiter in a restaurant adds no value. They don't make the food, they just bring it to you. But they can do it more efficiently than having the chef take the order, prepare the order, write an invoice (a check), accept payments, make change and prepare the space for the next diner.</p>

            <p>Actually, it's not.</p>
            <p>It is a picture of San Diego Bay, taken from my dad's front porch. It is a representation of San Diego Bay.</p>

            <p>In fact, these last two images depended on the same data sets used very differently. Both are valid, useful ideas. Both convey the same information in different ways.</p>
            <p>If a client made a request for data stored in a database, a server could respond with a snapshot of representational data from that point in time and even apply filters based on parameters from the client's request.</p>
            <p>Representational State may be an image, or a sound byte, or an MP4 video, or a table of data, or any other data object.</p>

    <p>After reading through my thoughts about REST APIs above, take a look at these explanation and see if they help.</p>
    <p>I know there are a lot of video explanations of REST APIs to be found. I kind of like the way that <strong>clever techie</strong> explains it.</p>
