        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This week we will launch our semester-long development project. The project will evolve over the duration of the course. Each week's assignment is designed to highlight a particular phase of the Software Development Life Cycle <strong>(SDLC).</strong></p>
        <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GU-YWDqM-ZljYHGs1iDNPg.jpeg" alt="Phases of the SDLC" width="598" height="300" /></p>
        <p>Although most engineers agree that there will be some inherent recursion and overlap between the phases of the SDLC, and that the process framework will be tailored according to the scope of each project, the sequence and objective of each phase shouldn't be overlooked.</p>
        <p>This week you'll be identifying and researching project ideas. In the next couple of weeks, you'll narrow the scope and present your idea and preliminary design to your peers, gather feedback, and further refine your project plan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your project doesn't need to be brand new and unique, but your implementation will.</p>
        <p>Begin to think about the kind of project to showcase. List the specific functionalities of the chosen kind of project, and some preliminary investigation toward implementing the project. All projects must include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a data component
                <ul>
                    <li>The data will be stored in a database</li>
                    <li>Data access will be via an intermediate API</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>and an interface component
                <ul>
                    <li>There may be multiple applications accessing the API for external users and administration</li>
                    <li>Applications may be web, native mobile apps, console apps, or platform-specific native applications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <em> There is a lot of detail and room for interpretation here. Now is the time to ask questions. Discord is a good place to discuss your questions. </em>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <div class="ic-flash">
                <p>This project was intended for developing cloud-hosted web applications.</p>
                <p>It is still my recommendation that you consider developing your project for this platform, but many students will have compelling reasons for developing for another purpose.</p>
                <p>Your project will include a database, accessed through an API, and a front-end GUI. This is well-suited for a web app, hosted locally or on another server or servers. We will be discussing your approach over the next couple of weeks, so now is a good time to consider options.</p>
            </div>
            <p>For this project, start by browsing the internet and considering websites that you commonly visit. What is it about the site that makes it useful? Are there other sites that enable similar functionality? What makes it appealing? What problem does it solve?</p>
            <ul>The project is designed to:
                <li>give a realistic look at the larger life cycle of taking ideas and turning them into useful software-based systems</li>
                <li>provide insight into the organizational and inter-personal aspects of project management</li>
                <li>give experience with change management, builds and controls, and other management disciplines necessary to keep projects heading towards success (and keep costs within budget!)</li>
                <li>give design, build, test and support experience with software systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is an individual project. Each student is building a portfolio that reflects their growth and development as a software and systems professional.</p>
            <p>It is also a collaborative project. There will be opportunity to discuss and work with classmates informally and formally as parts of task-focused teams.</p>
            <p>If two or more students have closely aligned projects, a shared database solution may also be acceptable. If you want to take this approach, please discuss with me. Database schema can be developed and managed jointly, and data populated individually but the front-end applications should still be unique.</p>
            <p>Some of these deliverables will be formal documents, or code files, or reports; others will be accomplished with formal or informal presentations, discussions, whiteboarding, or other options.</p>
            <p>Projects will be hosted on public Github repositories. The project owner will maintain all control of the code and artifacts, but these will have public read-only visibility.</p>
            <p>The instructor will guide the project and the process, step by step.</p>

            <h2>Sample Ideas</h2>
            <p>You may choose your own project. Here is a list of sample projects for you to get started.</p>
            <p>This list is intended to spark ideas, not limit them. You may choose one of these or something else entirely.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>School system</dt>
                <dd>This may consist of a student module, an instructor module, a curriculum module, and provides for the assignment of instructors to classes, students to classes, course management, student management, an d instructor management. As example would be the California State University (CSU) student information system.</dd>
                <dt>Electronic learning system</dt>
                <dd>This may consist of a collection of courses. Each course may allow for tests, quizzes, exercises, research papers, discussions, etc. As example would be Cougarview.</dd>
                <dt>An auction system.</dt>
                <dd>This my consist of a sellers module, a bidders module, a purchase module, and provide for different kinds of sales (i.e., open bidding, bidding with reserve, buy now, etc.). It would include user registrations and appropriate databases of auctions, transactions, etc. An example would be eBay.</dd>
                <dt>Messaging system</dt>
                <dd>This would include user registrations, posting messages, sending messages, composing groups, and similar functionality. An example would be Twitter.</dd>
                <dt>Encyclopedia</dt>
