        <h3>All of <em>Us</em></h3>
        <em>Really? Again?</em> (Yes, of course.)
        <ul style="margin-left: 10%;">
            <li>In polite society, we meet and introduce ourselves. It's not a bad thing.<br />And I have a Discussion board set up just for that purpose. (<em> Hey, you can get easy points for it! </em>).<br /><em>This one is a little different, please read the instructions.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>All of <em>This</em></h3>
        <em>How is this going to work?</em>
        <p>First, there are no scheduled meetings. Except of course optional office hours. But you won't be doing this alone. Office hours are a great place to check in, ask questions, or just visit. <strong>Discord</strong> is a good virtual meeting place, and a great place to ask and answer questions and share ideas. And it's always there!</p>
        <p>This course is designed to be very much a <em>hands-on</em> experience. You will be expected to search for solutions when you run into a challenge and try to apply them. There will be some reading and some videos to explain finer points of solutions development, and more importantly there will be opportunities to design and create.</p>
        <p>My career began in research. In that environment, I was primarily responsible for finding creative solutions for real world data collection and analysis in challenging environments. Sometimes it meant writing software for instrument control and data processing on a small ship rolling in heavy seas. Sometimes I was building cabinets, designing and creating electrical and plumbing solutions for a mobile shipboard lab facility. Sometimes it was negotiating with shipping agents and import/export documentation in foreign ports. Always, it involved a changing set of requirements, analysis, design, and implementation.</p>
        <p>Moving into the private sector, I ran IT departments for large banking operations, again looking for creative solutions to apply emerging technologies.</p>
        <p>Then, for many more years, I worked as a systems engineer and later project and program manager for large government contractors.</p>
        <p>Project management and systems engineering have different perspectives and approaches but they have many shared objectives. In this course, we will explore the end-to-end activities that are part of software solution development.</p>
        <p>Although eah of the student projects will be individual efforts, collaboration will be an important part of the experience also.</p>

        <p><em>I found an #ERROR!</em></p>
        <p>Yes. There are probably a few. This is an evolving course and much of what you are seeing is very much a work in progress. If you have questions or find something that just doesn't make sense, it may well be that something is missing, incorrect, images not appearing, broken links, or something that could just be clearer. Please let me know. Peer review and constructive feedback is always appreciated.</p>
