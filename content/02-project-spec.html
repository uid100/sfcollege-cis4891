    <h3>Preliminary selection</h3>
    <p>Students select one project from their list to focus on for their project this should include a formal investigation of the requirements of the project. If possible, identify similar applications that have been written and compare and contrast the objectives.</p>
    <p class="boxed-paragraph">This application concept may be one or a combination of the concepts from the last assignment, or it may be something completely different.</p>
    <p>The deliverable is a six to eight paragraph project proposal. This should contain a sufficient description of the project to allow construction of the project to begin.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Deliverable</h3>
    <p>Six to eight paragraph discussion of your proposed project. It should begin with a short introduction and conclude with a short conclusion. It should include discussions of the purpose of the software, an overall description of the high-level functional requirements of the software (that is, what the software will actually do), a survey of the relevant literature available that will assist you in completing your project, a short discussion of similar software, and a brief discussion of your project plan. Your writeup is not limited to two pages, and can include other sections that you feel will help the reader in understanding your proposal.</p>
    <p>Remember that every system application has input, processing, and output. Identify what the process will be collecting (input) and what it will be producing (output).</p>
    <p>Spend some time thinking about this. Your project will include creating a database and using an API.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What data will you store</li>
        <li>What is the source for the data (upload? web scrape? external API?)</li>
        <li>What are some ways the data could be used?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your paper should have a title, author, and date. Use headings in your proposal. These should should have appropriate section and subsection headings if appropriate.</p>
