        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>In the last module we took a look at the different phases of the SDLC. There are different management processes that can overlay these, but whether you take a traditional waterfall approach or a more dynamic <em>agile</em> track with kanban, scrum, and even with XP, they all begin with some amount of analysis.</p>
        <p>Put simply, decide what you're going to do before you do it.</p>
        <p>For this module, consider the ideas which grew from last week's list and decide how it coalesces into a single direction. This does not need to be the final design, but it needs to be clear enough that you have direction to get started, and can express your idea to others. Often, documenting the plan will help to make it clearer to yourself also.</p>
        <p>As part of the process, we'll be implementing a data store and an API. When you are documenting your idea. Be sure to emphasize the various data input and output. This will help.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>API</h3>
        <p>Also in this module, I have put together some information about APIs. Most of this will be review, but it may also help to fill in some gaps in your understanding. I hope you find it helpful.</p>
