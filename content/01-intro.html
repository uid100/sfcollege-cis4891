                Since we don't have the opportunity to go around the classroom and have people 
                introduce themselves, we're going to do an online introduction and share a 
                little bit about ourselves.</li>

                This advanced level course, occurs late in your undergraduate path. At this stage, 
                most students will be working on closing this current chapter and likely starting 
                others. The paths leading to the prerequisite courses for this one has some 
                variability built into it. Everyone's journey has been unique and I am interested 
                in yours.</li>
            <li>
                As part of your introduction, tell us about the courses you have studied, at this 
                school, at others, or in any other professional or other area. How would you 
                summarize and describe what you are learning or have learned? What did you find 
                interesting? What do you wish you had spent more time learning?</li>
            <li>
                If you could advise other students starting down the same path, what would you 
                recommend, and what do you wish you had done differently?</li>
            <li>
                This is a small class, at the end of a long journey. Feel free to respecfully 
                interact with others in the discussion. It is not a requirement. <em>Remember 
                    to join our Discord channel to say hello.</em></li>
            <li>
                Organize your thoughts. Spelling, grammar and sentence structure matter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As always, posts and replies should be thoughtful and respectful.</p>
